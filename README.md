# PHPZevelop

This is a PHP framework for ease of use and adaptability. I am building it for personal use.
But if anybody wishes to fork it please feel free! Any comments and ideas are welcome.

Downloading the framework and running on a PHP webserver (Whether windows or unix) by default will display a help
site for explaining how to use it.

See the framework in action here: [http://zephni.com/phpzevelop](http://zephni.com/phpzevelop "PHPZevelop")</a>.
